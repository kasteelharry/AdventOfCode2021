# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

This repository contains all the code I used to solve the challenges
in the [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I have chosen to use Java this year again since that is what I am most familiar
with through my study [Technical University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/).
I might switch the language I will use during the AoC, but I will update this page in case I do 
switch.
